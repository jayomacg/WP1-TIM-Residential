\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

Understanding residential energy consumption in Ireland is key to exploring future residential decarbonisation pathways, and interpreting the results, so Section \ref{sec:Introduction} of this paper looks at Ireland's climate targets, energy policy and distinctive residential sector. While also examining how researchers have previously used Energy System Optimization Models (ESOMs) to analyse the residential sector.
Section \ref{LitR} describes the methodology used to develop the residential sector while also outlining the input data. The process of applying constraints, technologies, costs and demands in the model.  
Section \ref{Results} outlines the results obtained from selected scenarios. Section \ref{Discussion} discusses the strengths and weakness of the newly developed model and how it differs from other models. Lastly, section \ref{Conclusion} draws some conclusions on the model, results and discussion on future work.

 
\subsection{Residential Modelling}
\label{Intro:ESOM}

Energy System Optimisation Models (ESOMs) can be used to explore least cost pathways, as they consider a large amount of variables to satisfy demand, while accounting for complex sectoral interconnections within each time period. Some of the main ESOM frameworks include EnergyPLAN \cite{stergaard2015ReviewingSimulations}, MESSAGE \cite{Messner1995WorkingE}, TIMES \cite{Loulou2016DocumentationI}, Balmorel \cite{Wiese2018BalmorelModel}, TEMOA \cite{Hunter2013ModelingTemoa} and OSeMOSYS \cite{Howells2011OSeMOSYS:Development.}.While ESOM cover all the energy-related sectors, they can also be used to specifically explore the residential sector in higher granularity, some international examples are outlined in this section. 

\par For example, Li et al. \cite{Li2018IncorporatingModel} investigated the heating technology preference in UK, using UK TIMES Model (UKTM). As TIMES \cite{Loulou2016DocumentationI} assumes perfect foresight and \textit{``in reality, the behaviours of consumers is not always economically rational"} \cite{Li2018IncorporatingModel}. Li set out to incorporate a Discrete Choice Model (DCM) into TIMES to better reflect how homeowners choose heating technologies. The DCM was developed from a nationwide survey with 442 homeowners completing the survey. The nationwide survey identified the most influential factors for determining homeowners' preferences for heating systems. The DCM then estimated the probability of a heating technology selection and cost was found not to have a statistically significant impact on homeowners' choices. While Li's researcher has provided some initial insights, future work can improve the robustness and comprehensiveness of the insights, through more surveys and analysis.

Leibowicz et al. developed an expanded a version of the Open Source Energy Modeling System (OSeMOSYS) \cite{Howells2011OSeMOSYS:Development.} that integrates electricity generation and storage, residential building energy service demands, and end-use technologies \cite{Leibowicz2018OptimalServices}.Endogenous constraints on the market penetration rate of each technology and hourly service demand profiles are established and applied to the residential sector of Austin, Texas. Austin was chosen because of the high granularity data availability \cite{EnergyInc.}. Leibowicz et al. results find net present costs in the \textit{``Policy scenarios"} ( emissions declining linearly toward 10\% of their current level by 2050) are higher than \textit{``No Policy scenarios"} (No $CO_2$ regulations imposed ). However, the percentage increase in net present cost due to the policy diminishes with a more thermally efficient building stock. Leibowicz et al. also finds electrification to be the dominant strategy for cost-effectively decarbonizing urban residential dwellings. These insights show the strength of an ESOM, but the not all costs are taken into account in Leibowicz study, the capital cost associated with more thermally efficient buildings are not included.

Hedegard and Münster \cite{Hedegaard2013InfluenceOperation} utilised  Balmorel model \cite{Wiese2018BalmorelModel} to handle the integrated power and district heating system, to analyse how heat pumps with complementing heat storages affect wind power investments in Denmark. The model was disaggreated between a western and eastern Denmark region and the model covers Norway, Sweden, Finland and Germany, in order to cover import/export. Exogenous user constraints applied to the model, based on current Danish policy includes: Wind power must provide at least 50\% of the national electricity consumption by 2020, coal is phased out in heat and power plants by 2030 and Individual oil boilers are phased out by 2030. The results by find when investments in individual heat pumps are allowed, air to water heat pumps are installed in non-district heating areas. This represents a significant electricity demand in identifying individual heat pumps as highly competitive and can contribute significantly to facilitating larger wind power investments and reducing system costs, fuel consumption, and $CO_2$ emissions.
Hedegard and Münster found the system benefits of adding individual heat storage to the heat pumps are moderate, the main benefit is a reduced need for peak/reserve capacity investments. The Balmorel model has provided insights, but it does not cover all aspects of the power and heat system, such as start-up costs, minimum load requirements, or part load efficiencies. Nevertheless, the insights are valuable and the results can be soft-linked to other models for deeper analysis. 

Marczinkowski and Østergaard \cite{Marczinkowski2018ResidentialSystems} use EnergyPLAN model \cite{stergaard2015ReviewingSimulations} to explore the feasibility of photovoltaic (PV) systems installed at household level in combination with batteries in Samsø, which is known for being Denmark’s renewable energy island. 
The two approaches are observed for the location of the batteries in the PV system; communal battery system or an individual residential battery approach. Marczinkowski and Østergaard found communal batteries slightly more favourable from a technical energy systems perspective, one reason for this is the wind power could also be stored in communal batteries. When identical communal and individual battery capacities where compared, it was fond  64\% of residential electricity demand is satisfied by a individual battery and only 36\% by a communal battery. While the battery location was explored, the PV system location was not, further investigation into the optimal PV system location could provide further insights. The household occupancy behaviour with and without household batteries on the PV system could alter the optimal pathway.

%The Cambridge Housing Model (BEIS) ses English Housing Survey data, coupled to a SAP ( UK's BER equivalent ) energy calculator, to estimate energy use and CO2 emissions for all homes in England, broken down by final use. The CHM reads in the EHS dwelling for each case and performs building physics calculations to determine energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions, by use and by fuel type. Multiplying the energy use and CO2 emissions by the associated weighting and summing across all cases gives total values for England.

\subsubsection{Ireland: Residential Modelling}
\label{Intro:ESOMIreland}

ESOM models have been used to optimise Ireland's entire energy system \cite{Chiodi2013ModellingSystem}\cite{Connolly2021AalborgEnergy-System}, however few Irish studies use ESOM models to explore the residential sector, two examples of Irish ESOM focusing on the residential sector are detailed here.

In 2014, Rogan et al. \cite{Rogan2014LEAPsSystem} linked OSeMOYOS, an ESOM to the Long Range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) simulation model, to explore specific energy efficiency policies not only in the residential sector, but also in transport, industry and services sector in Ireland. The bottom up development of the residential sector in LEAP was combined with the cost optimisation capabilities of OSeMOYOS. Three scenarios are explored, namely, the reference scenario, energy efficiency scenario and energy efficiency+ scenario. The reference assume that 300,000 existing dwellings will undergo a shallow retrofit from 2009 to 2020. In the reference scenario the residential total energy consumption rose 6.7 \% in 2020, compared to 2008. The share of space and water heating decreased from 82 \% to 77 \% in that period. In the energy efficiency scenario 800,000 residential dwellings are retrofitted between 2009 and 2020, combined with the effect of other policies such as building regulations and lighting, resulted in a reduction in of energy consumption of 9.9 \% in 2020, compared to the reference scenario. The energy efficiency+ scenario also allows for 800,000 residential dwellings to be retrofitting, but accounts for deeper retrofits. The results in a reduction in of energy consumption of 16.5 \% in 2020, compared to the reference scenario.Rogan et al. discussed the barriers, obstacles to investment, split incentives and information gaps which restrict energy efficiency improvements in the residential sector. The importance for policy to not only look at number of retrofit, but also the depth of retrofit works, is shown by the difference in scenarios. The model also found considerable scope for energy savings to be made through improved building regulations. 

In 2018, Thellufsen et al. \cite{Thellufsen2019ImplementingIreland} investigated the potential for the implementation of district heating in both the commercial and residential sectors of Ireland. The paper analyses the $CO_2-80$ scenario ( 80 \% $CO_2$ reduction in 2050, compared to 1990 ) with and without district heating using the previous Irish TIMES model and EnergyPLAN. The previous version of Irish TIMES did not account for district heating, so EnergyPLAN is used to investigate the operation and  feasibility of district heating in Ireland. A sensitivity analysis was preformed on investment costs, heat grid losses and discount rates, however in all cases the inclusion of district heating is optimal. The final results find district heating reduces fuel consumption by 3.5 \% and the conversion of 37 \% of the Irish heat demand to district heating is found to be optimal. Both the TIMES model and climate target are superseded and the study did not include the future heat savings expected from retrofitting, nevertheless this study has provided insights on the potential of district heating. 


\par  The majority of previous modelling on the residential sector in Ireland has involved bottom-up residential sector only models, rather than energy system models specifically examining the residential sector. Nevertheless, the residential models have provided insights on input data and methodology approach used in Ireland, some of which are outlined below.

Clinch and Healy analysed different aspects of thermal comfort in the Irish residential sector. This was the first comprehensive analysis of the residential sector, their studies examined fuel poverty \cite{Healy2002FuelIreland}, excess winter mortality \cite{Clinch2000HousingMortality}, market failures \cite{Clinch2000DomesticFailure} and energy efficiency  \cite{Clinch2003ValuingModel,Clinch2000DomesticFailure,Clinch2001Cost-benefitEfficiency,Clinch2001ModellingEfficiency}. In 2000 Clinch and Healy developed and published a domestic energy efficiency model to analyse the cost-benefit of energy efficiency \cite{Clinch2001Cost-benefitEfficiency}.The Energy-Assessment Model (EAM) is a bottom-up model developed in Mircsoft Excel which incorporates 1,824 representative dwellings ( 8 building archetypes, 12 levels of insulation and 19 heating systems ), this was not linked to other sectors of the economy and only looked at space and water heating. A cost-benefit model (CBM) was fitted to the EAM to facilitate the conversion of the physical estimates into monetary amounts. Under the predicted scenario, energy savings easily outweighing programme costs, representing a benefit-cost ratio of 1.7.The benefits of reduced sickness, hospitalisation and drugs and mortality, were quantified, this moved the  benefit-cost ratio up to 3.0.
The same model was used by Clinch, Healy and King \cite{Clinch2001ModellingEfficiency} in addition three models of householder spending on energy are developed here to to evaluate the human behavioural component
into the computer model. the modelling process involved developing a computer model of the energy performance of the existing dwelling stock. It was noted, energy consumption predicted by the model is considerably higher than given in the national energy balance, due to intertal temperature assumptions. 
The model showed the energy-efficiency programme ( all houses retrofitted to 1997 thermal building standards in 10 years ) represents a saving of 24 \% when compared to the reference scenarios. 

In 2011 Dineen and Ó Gallachóir \cite{Dineen2011ModellingHeating} developed a residential bottom-up model to assess the impacts of measures in Ireland's National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP). The model focused on energy efficiency of space and water heating by examining technology and building fabric efficiency. The building fabric efficiency of newly occupied dwellings developed takes into account the theoretical increase in energy efficiency due to improved 2008 and 2010 building regulations. Space heating demand accounted for 70\% of household energy consumption in newly built dwellings in 1997, down to just under 60\% in 2006 and the model is predicts a reduction to 27\% by 2015.The paper acknowledges retrofitting of existing stock will play a large role in meeting energy efficiency targets, however it is not examined. Nor is the affect of internal temperatures on energy efficiency improvements.  
\par In 2013 Ahern et al.\cite{Ahern2013StateStock} investigated thermal retrofit measures to the existing detached, oil centrally heated, rural housing stock. A base geometry according to age bands and thermal characteristics was created in the study. The heat load for a statistical occupancy and year was established. The default values used in some of the BER database variables where highlighted. For example,  there are assumed U-values when the roof insulation thickness is unknown, this is based on age, but there are no U-values for uninsulated roofs despite a 2001 survey found 18\% of detached housing in Ireland had no roof insulation. Ahern et al. found dwellings built post-2000 consume the greatest amount of energy (kWh/annum), due to their large floor area. Concluding that the majority of energy efficiency progress for thermal use in Irish dwellings is being offset. The model thermal improvement measures resulted a reduction of running costs and CO2 emissions by an average of 65\% for houses constructed prior to 1979, this resulted in an average 12-year payback. Houses built in 1979 or after resulted in an average 26\% reduction in running costs and $CO_2$ emissions from retrofit measures.

\par In 2015 Dineen et al.\cite{Dineen2015ImprovedSource} built on previous work in examining new dwelling, to examining energy savings potential of energy efficiency improvement measures of the existing dwelling stock. The Dwelling Energy Assessment Procedure (DEAP) model used, relied on the BER database, which accounted for 18\% of all Irish dwellings, currently the database has more than doubled and accounts for over 50\%. DEAP is the national tool for BER calculation and checking building regulation compliance. The model used 175 archetype dwellings ( 5 building types, 7 energy bands and 5 wall construction types ) and 6 different retrofit measures were applied. BER database filters were used in this model, the BER filters from this study, were updated and applied in TIM. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the effects of internal temperature and rebound. It was found that there was approximately a 7.5\% change in energy consumption for every 1$^{\circ}$C internal temperature shift. Concluding, BER standard assumptions overestimate dwelling energy consumption and that the average internal temperature across the Irish dwelling stock may be closer to 18$^{\circ}$C than 21$^{\circ}$C.

The Archetype Dwelling Energy Model (ArDEM-SQL) was developed by Mac Uidhir et al.\cite{Uidhir2020ImprovingDecisions}. ArDEM-SQL converts the Irish BER public database into Microsoft SQL language and then calculates annual energy consumption to simulate the potential for improved energy efficiency gains within the existing retrofit programs. Mac Uidhir et al. specifically examined the Better Energy Homes (BEH) scheme. The five most common retrofit combinations are simulated for each of 9 archetypes ( 3 energy rating types and 3 building types ). The results show that the alternative retrofit scenarios can achieve additional energy efficiency gains of up to 86\% can be achieved when compared the baseline scenario. This shows the the type of retrofit and type of house can have a huge affect on the energy saved. 
Greater energy savings are possible when retrofit measures are applied to less energy efficient dwellings (E, F and G-ratings ), albeit the ``rebound effect" was not accounted for due to insufficient data on the scale of the rebound effect and the relative difference between the two scenarios examined is considered negligible.   


Finally, it is worth mentioning SEAI’s National Energy Modelling Framework (NEMF), which is a suite of modelling tools used for modelling the Irish energy system. Some of the main models used in the NEMF include:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Core Structural Model of the Irish Economy (COSMO)  is a macro-economic model used by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) to create a baseline forecast of energy consumption by sector} \cite{Bergin2017COSMO:Ireland}
\item{PLEXOS is a power systems modeling tool used for electricity modeling and planning}\cite{PLEXOSExemplar}
\item{Energy-efficiency policy analysis tool informs the energy efficiency estimates} \cite{Scheer2015UnlockingTob}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Consumer Choice Model determines the attractiveness of energy efficiency finance options}\cite{SustainableEnergyAuthorityofIreland2017BehaviouralSector}
\end{itemize}
\item{BioHEAT is a techno-economic simulation model of bioenergy and heat, used by SEAI to support policy decision in Ireland.}\cite{Durusut2018BioHEAT:Sectors}
\end{itemize}

The listed models are some of models used within SEAI's NEMF to model the impact of incentives and opportunities created by specific policy instruments.


The models described in this section included a range of national ESOMs and bottom-up residential models. The models have varied objectives such as exploring consumer choices, PV battery systems location, evaluating health effects of retrofitting and integration of bio-energy and heat. The thermal efficiency of dwellings is a common objective in Irish models, due to the poor thermal efficiency of the dwelling stock and the every growing BER database is providing high data granularity input to these models. The internal temperature is also analysed in some of the studies, a recurring theme is the wide range of internal temperatures. 
The bottom-up residential models are typically simulation models looking at specific policy. The complexity of the models have increased significantly in the last 20 years, in Ireland the models starting out in Microsoft Excel and switching to Microsoft SQL. 
There has been few studies on the Irish residential sector using ESOMs, as the residential bottom-up models are preferred when focusing on that sector. The studies on Irish ESOM typically do not focus on the residential sector, instead they focus on the overall energy system, electricity generation or transport. The use of ESOM to explore DH in Ireland, allows for insights which the bottom-up simulation models cannot provide. The connection between waste heat in electricity and industry can show the optimal solution for district heating in commercial and residential sectors.  

\subsection{Ireland: Residential Sector}
\label{Intro:IreRSD}

Ireland’s distinctive energy sectors are further separated from other EU member states when focusing on the residential sector. This is largely down to Ireland’s higher reliance on fossil fuels, lower building thermal efficiency, larger dwellings and rural settlement patterns. This is illustrated by the fact only 5.8\% of the population of Ireland were living in apartments in 2018, the lowest in EU-27 and well below the 25.3\% average \cite{EurostatDistributionSurveyilc_lvho01}, furthermore 71.4\% of the Irish population are deemed to be living in dwellings too large, where the EU-27 rate is 33\% \cite{EurostatShareSurveyilc_lvho50a}. The low thermal efficiency of Ireland's dwelling stock is highlighted by two facts; (i) 2021 building regulations require a 70\% reduction of CO\textsubscript{2} emissions in new dwellings compared to dwellings built in 2005 \cite{DepartmentofHousingGov.ieBuildings}, and (ii) Central Statistics Office (CSO) data states approx. 85\% of residential buildings are 2005 or older. Furthermore, Ireland's fossil fuel dependency is underpinned by home heating oil accounting for the largest share of fuel usage in the residential sector at 37\% \cite{SustainableEnergyAuthorityofIreland2018EnergySector}, of which all is imported \cite{OCleirigh2020ENERGYReport}.

In the last 30 years, the extraction of indigenous peat has declined and consequently peat consumption has halved, in 2018 peat accounted for 12.3\% of residential Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. GHG emissions from coal in the residential sector also declined to 6.9\% in 2018 \cite{Howley2005ENERGY-RELATEDIreland}. However, the decline in peat and coal has been offset by more significant growth in oil in the same period, where oil accounted for 34.8\% of residential GHG emissions in 2018 \cite{Howley2005ENERGY-RELATEDIreland}. While, gas availability is limited to some urban areas, and accounted for 15.5\% of residential GHG emission in 2018 \cite{Howley2005ENERGY-RELATEDIreland}. 
The residential sector relied on fossil fuels for over 90\% of thermal energy in 2018, consequently Ireland currently has the lowest renewable heat of among EU member states, at only 6.3\% \cite{Eurostat2021ShareSourcesnrg_ind_ren}. Preliminary results from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have indicated a 9\% increase of residential GHG emissions in 2020, mainly due to low home heating oil prices and covid-related restrictions.

\subsubsection{Current Greenhouse Gas Emissions}
\label{Intro:GHG}

Under 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines, Ireland’s residential sector accounted for 14.2\% of GHGs emissions in 2018 \cite{Howley2005ENERGY-RELATEDIreland}. Focusing on energy-related GHG emissions only, the residential sector directly accounts for 24\% of GHG emissions. Fig. \ref{fig:Ireland2018GHG} shows the energy-related GHG disaggregated between transport, heat and electricity. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={align=center}, pin distance=17mm]
    \pie[cloud,text=inside,radius = 2.4]{34/Agriculture,7/Other,59/Energy-related}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Ireland 2018 GHG Share \cite{Howley2005ENERGY-RELATEDIreland}}
    \label{fig:Ireland2018GHG}
\end{figure}

Where the residential sector is the direct source 47\% of heat and 30\% of electricity GHG emissions, the residential sector is therefore a pivotal sector in decarbonising energy in Ireland. 



\subsubsection{Climate Targets}

Under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the Irish government has proposed legally binding national targets to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 51\% in 2030 compared to 2018. The Act also proposes a long-term target to achieve a climate neutral economy or ``net-zero" by 2050 \cite{2021Climate2021}. These targets accounts for all GHGs - both Emission Trading System (ETS) emissions and non-ETS emissions, and sets out make sectoral five year carbon budgets  a legal requirement to aid progress of the forementioned long-term targets. 
\par The EU's first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) which had a 40\% GHG reduction target (first NDC), has been succeeded by a new target of at least a 55\% GHG reduction target (updated NDC) by 2030 compared to 1990 levels \cite{SUBMISSIONSTATES}. Ireland's Climate Action Plan 2019 (CAP2019) complies with EU's first NDC, from which Irelands 30\% Non-ETS GHG reduction target in 2030 compared to 2005 levels was derived  \cite{DepartmentofCommunicationsClimateActionandEnvironment2019Climate2019}. Climate Action Plan 2021 will have to be more ambitious than its predecessor, CAP2019 as it must reflect EU's updated NDC target and take account of the national target also.
There are also renewable energy targets to consider for transport (RES-T), heat (RES-H) and electricity (RES-E) under renewable directive (EU) 2018/2001, and energy efficiency targets under (EU) 2018/2002.

\subsubsection{Current Energy Policy}
\label{Intro:Policy}
Ireland has set out national policy objectives under 10 strategic investment priorities \cite{Ireland2018ProjectFramework}. The first strategic investment priority is ``Compact Growth" which aims to  achieve \textit{``effective density and consolidation, rather than more sprawl of urban development, [as] a top priority"}. The densification of Ireland's main cities, will provide opportunities to improve the efficiency of heating, electricity and transport within and between cities. 
\par Specifically focusing on the energy sector, the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) produced in CAP2019  \cite{EPA2018EPAReport} found electricity \& transport are most cost effective sectors for energy decarbonisation \cite{DepartmentofCommunicationsClimateActionandEnvironment2019DecarbonisationIreland}. CAP2019 findings show the most cost effective solution to decarbonising the residential sector, is to receive higher amounts of low carbon electricity.



%The CAP2019 MACC, shown in Fig.\ref{fig:CAP2019:MACC} provides $>300$ of the most cost-effective technologies options to reduce Non-ETS GHG by 30\% in 2030 compared to 2005 levels. 
%The x-axis (width of each bar chart) shows the potential reduction of annual $MtCO2_{eq}$. The y-axis (height of each bar chart ) shows the associated average cost of abating one tonne of $CO2_{eq}$ over the 2021 to 2030 period. The columns are organised from the most economical (left side) to the most expensive technology (right side) in $EUR/tCO2_{eq}$ \cite{DepartmentofCommunicationsClimateActionandEnvironment2019Climate2019}.
%The options specific to the residential sector are: 

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item{Retrofit oil boiler existing dwellings to B2 equivalent}
 %   \item{Switch from oil boilers to heat pumps in existing dwellings}
 %   \item{Retrofit gas boiler and solid fuel stove existing dwellings to B2 equivalent}
 %   \item{Introduce CO2-free heating in new buildings}\cite{DepartmentofCommunicationsClimateActionandEnvironment2019Climate2019}

%\end{figure}
%For example, Figure \ref{fig:CAP2019:MACC} shows the retrofitting of oil boilers is expected to reduce the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) (ie. save money), but only abate a small amount of carbon, whereas switching oil boilers to heat pumps will increase TCO (ie. cost money) but the expected abatement of carbon is far greater. 

In Ireland the decarbonisation of the electricity is underway, with carbon intensity falling annually to 375 $gCO_2/kWh$ in 2018, which is 40\% lower than 2005 levels \cite{Howley2005ENERGY-RELATEDIreland}. 
Ireland uses both the \textit{carrot} (subsidy) and \textit{stick} (tax) approach to direct private investment towards low carbon or renewable energy. A €15/ $tCO_2$ carbon tax was introduced in 2009 to reduce investment in fossil fuels, and the increasing carbon tax rate has resulted in tax receipts growing every year from 2010 to 2018 \cite{Oireachtas2019AnOffice}. Ireland's current carbon tax of €33.50/ $tCO_2$ will rise to €100/ $tCO_2$ in 2030. The Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes were designed to incentivise renewable electricity investment to achieve legally binding renewable targets under 2009/28/EC. REFIT operates by guaranteeing a minimum price for electricity over a 15 year period. The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) replaced REFIT in 2020. RESS supports to renewable electricity projects to help Ireland achieve 2030 climate targets, especially the 70\% renewable electricity target. 
% Almost 800 MW of solar has been approved in RESS-1 \cite{Eirgrid2020RenewableResults}, this greatly exceeds the current solar capacity of 16 MW, while making significant progress towards the CAP2019 target of 1500 MW solar by 2030.
\par Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) have a key role in the rollout of retrofitting and heat pumps in existing homes. In parallel, new dwellings must achieve a minimum of 20\% renewable energy. The ambient heat used in heat pumps is included as a renewable energy, heat pumps are therefore the preferred heating technology despite the high capital costs. As mentioned in Section \ref{Intro:IreRSD}, new buildings in Ireland produce 70\% less GHG emissions than buildings in 2005, along with CAP2019 plans to retrofit 500,000 existing homes to at least a  ‘B2’ energy rating by 2030, highlights the energy efficiency first approach in the residential sector. 
\par Gas Network Ireland (GNI) have set a 18\% biomethane target for 2030 \cite{Ervia2019VisionIreland}, where CAP2019 only set a 3\% biomethane target for 2030 \cite{DepartmentofCommunicationsClimateActionandEnvironment2019Climate2019}. GNI anticipates that by 2026 or 2027 the supply from Corrib ( Irelands only indigenous gas supply, which provided 61\% of gas in 2018 ) will be less than 30\% of 2018 levels \cite{OCleirigh2020ENERGYReport}. The gas network currently reaches 40\% or 680,000 dwellings in urban areas, but with the ``Compact Growth" policy strategy a higher share of building may have access to the gas network in the future. A major barrier to increasing biomethane from an agricultural source in the gas network is the cost, it was the most expensive option in the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) produced in CAP2019.
\par Ireland has one of the lowest shares of District Heating (DH) in Europe at less than 1\%  \cite{Gartland2016AIreland}. The ``Compact Growth" policy strategy and advancement in DH control will strengthen the case for DH networks to play a part in decarbonisaing the residential sector. CAP2019 plans to have approx. 0.4\% of heating provided by DH in 2030, research using TIMES and EnergyPLAN has shown that 37\% of heating provided by DH is optimal if Ireland is to reduce GHG emissions by 80\% in 2050, compared to 1990 \cite{Thellufsen2019ImplementingIreland}. While Irish District Energy Association (IrDEA) suggest 57\% of heat can be sourced from DH, if supporting policy and regulation was in place. District Heating will likely play a role, however Gartland points out a range of organisational, technical, regulatory and economic barriers to DH growth in Ireland \cite{Gartland2016AIreland}. 
\par While it maybe optimal to use Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) in transport, it is also considered in the residential sector, as it can provide a cheap alternative for the 700,000 Irish dwellings using home heating oil ( mostly kerosene). HVO which meets the EU sustainability criteria, reduces GHG emissions by 60\% as compared to fossil fuels \cite{Soam2019FactorsSweden}. The capacity of HVO is growing in Europe, but HVO is currently about twice the price of kerosene. HVO can be used to replace kerosene, albeit with cost of up to €400 per oil boiler, however there is no policy for HVO in the residential sector. 


\section{Methodology}
\label{LitR}

%``How should Ireland set GHG targets in the residential sector?” 

\subsection{TIMES Energy System Optimisation Model}
\label{Overview}
\par  The expertise among energy policy researchers in Ireland combined with the global network of Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program (ETSAP) modellers, makes TIMES the preferred ESOM to explore Ireland's decarbonisation pathways. Previous versions of the Irish TIMES model were extracted from the Pan European TIMES model, and then updated with specific national data and assumptions. The previous Irish TIMES models were used to provide informative reports on Irish climate policy \cite{Gallachoir2012EPAModel,Deane2017Irish2,Gallachoir2020The3,Deane2013TechnicalIreland,IrishGovernment2017National2017}.  
There is a need for a new ESOM to be built specifically to explore Ireland's new 2030 and 2050 climate targets and sectoral five-year carbon budgets, the new ``TIMES Ireland Model" (TIM) was built in 2021 to address this need \textbf{(SOURCE)}.
\par TIMES is a bottom-up optimisation energy-environment model with perfect foresight which is used to analyse various levels of spatial, temporal and sectoral resolution. Exogenous technical, physical, and regulatory constraints can be applied and technologies have specified fuel types, efficiencies, lifetimes, availability, environmental characteristics and fixed, variable and operation costs. TIMES uses a linear programming optimizer matrix in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS), to compute all calculations. 

\par The function of partial equilibrium operates whereby prices and quantities in each time period are such that the suppliers produce exactly the quantities demanded by the consumers and therefore the total economic surplus  (sum of the suppliers’ and consumers’ surpluses) is maximized \cite{Loulou2016DocumentationI}. The TIMES objective is therefore to minimize the total cost of the system, by solving for the following:
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
NPV = {\sum_{r=1}^{R}  \sum_{y\in YEARS}(1 + d_{r,y})^{REFYR-y}}
\cdot {ANNCOST(r,y)} 
\end{split}
%\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1 \]
\label{Eq:ObjectiveFunction}
\end{equation}
Where, $NPV$ is the net present value of the total cost for all regions ; $ANNCOST(r,y)$ is the total annual cost in region r and year y; $d_{r,y}$ is the general discount rate; $REFYR$ is the reference year for discounting; YEARS is the set of years for which there are costs; and $R$ is the set of regions in the area of study.


%Add description of TIMES and how residential sector is represented to the Methodology section; - Olex Email
%The TIMES-Ireland Model (TIM) is an optimisation model of the Irish energy system, which calculates the cost-5optimal fuel and technology mix to meet future energy service demands in the transport, buildings, industry and agriculture sectors, while respecting constraints in greenhouse-gas emissions, primary energy resources and feasible deployment rates.

\subsection{Residential}
\label{LitR:RES}
The new structure and updated technological and macroeconomic data will provide more robust insights on sectoral five-year carbon budgets towards 2030 and 2050 than previous models. The residential sector was developed in parallel with other sectors in TIM, and concurrently with the new Irish LEAP model, which allows for more accessible soft-linking to provide more robust analytical insights by combining simulation and optimisation, and to exchange expertise between modelling teams. Fig.\ref{fig:RES} illustrates the flow of energy from fuel to demand in the residential sector.

The BER database provides the base year bottom-up energy consumption data, this is extrapolated to represent the entire stock and cross-checked with the top-down energy consumption from the 2018 SEAI Energy Balance. To compare from the two databases, fuels were were combined and condensed down to 13 fuels in TIM. Table \ref{Table:Fuels} shows an overview of the fuels combined from the different data sources.

In TIM fuels such as coal, represent a combination of coal fuels from the two different databases. Kerosene accounts for over 70 \% of oil usage, while Gasoil accounts for most of the remaining share, the fuels have similar properties and there was no evidence to support keeping separate fuels would provide insights to residential decarbonisation. The exception is ambient heat, which could potentially provide insights to residential decarbonisation by seperating it into ambient heat for space heating and ambient heat for water heating. The solid multi-fuel from the BER database represents an open fire or stove which is heated by either coal, peat or wood. Through analysis of the SEAI Energy Balance and BER database, the fuel share assigned for coal, peat and wood is 19.4 \%, 74.4 \% and 6.2 \% respectively. 
There are two types of energy services represented in Table \ref{fig:RES} - Non-Archetype and Archetype. Non-archetype energy services fill in the lack of data on archetype energy services. The six non-archetype energy services, are not dependant on the type of dwelling in the model and the base year quantity is the total national consumption of that energy service, this bottom-up data was retrieved from SEAI Residential Energy Report \cite{SustainableEnergyAuthorityofIreland2018EnergySector} and cross-checked with the POTEnCIA (Policy Oriented Tool for Energy and Climate Change Impact Assessment) database and the SEAI Energy Balance, more details on non-archeype services are found in Section \ref{LitR:Lighting,Appliances}. The four archetype energy services are dependent on  building archetype and data is sourced from the BER database, which is discussed in Section \ref{LitR:StockData}. The internal temperature adjustment for space heating is detailed in Section \ref{LitR:StockData}. The demand for archetype and non-archetype energy services is based on the growth of residential dwellings, which is detailed in section \ref{LitR:Demands}.

\subsubsection{House Stock Data}
\label{LitR:StockData}


The BER database, which represents half of the dwelling stock, highlights the affect year of construction has on expected energy consumption, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:BERAge}. The BERs labels are categorised based on expected energy consumption, with A1 representing the lowest expected energy consumption ($\leq 74 kWh/m^2/year$) and G representing the highest expected energy consumption ($ >450 kWh/m^2/year$). The BERs are developed from the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2002/91/ EC, which helps to better understand the housing stock. BERs are required for new houses, rented houses, sold houses and renovated houses.

 \caption{Building Energy Rating by Age}

\end{figure}

ENERGY CONSUMPTION CHARACTERISTICS of Houses - Table?

Theoretically G-rated BERs consume more energy and consequently have higher energy bills to maintain a comfortable internal temperature, but in reality G-rated dwellings have low internal temperatures, which is a reason for Ireland's high excessive winter mortality \cite{Clinch2000HousingMortality}. Fuel Poverty which which is defined as when a \textit{``household spends 10\% or more of income to achieve adequate warmth"} is a major contributor to the high excessive winter deaths. An Element Energy report claimed 28\% of Irish households were in fuel poverty in 2015  \cite{ElementEnergy2015Bottom-upIreland}. Fuel Allowance and the Household Benefits provides support to low income households to alleviate fuel poverty. These payments have been increased over time with a further increase made in Budget 2020, coinciding with the increase in the carbon tax \cite{,EuropeanUnion2020EUObservatory}. Kerr's study finds an explicit link between fuel poverty and social welfare policy in Ireland \cite{,EuropeanUnion2020EUObservatory,Kerr2019PoliticsFrance} and O’Meara highlights the health issues associated with Fuel Poverty \cite{OMeara2016AIreland}. Ironically, it can be argued this places low income households deeply dependent on fossil fuels for health.
\par BERs do not take account of actual usage based on occupancy behaviour or occupancy density, nor does it take account of the size of the dwelling. The BER labels do therefore leave a gap between actual consumption and expected consumption, the literature review explains how this problem was tackled.





The SEAI BER Public database, which is Ireland's national Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) register, which complies with the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2018/844/EU (EPBD). The four energy service type are derived from the database - space heating, water heating, pumps \& fans and lighting. The space heating calculation (IS EN 13790) used to estimate the expected energy consumption per dwelling, makes some assumptions. The internal temperature assumption has a large error, therefore TIM has made adjustments so that the total consumption of energy services is calibrated to the base year data. IS EN 13790 assumes all living areas ( living room, sitting room and possibly kitchen) in dwellings are heated to 21$^{\circ}$C and non-living areas ( bedroom, bathroom, hallways ) are heated to 18$^{\circ}$C. We know this is not the case, Table \ref{Table:InternalTemps} outlines the residential internal temperature assumptions in TIM.

The ArDEM-SQL, which was described in Section \ref{Intro:ESOMIreland} is a simulation model built on IS EN 13790. ArDEM-SQL alters primary energy consumption from the BER database, by changing internal temperatures which are used in TIM. 
%Healy & Clinch reported that fuel-poor households were more likely to be experiencing colder temperatures than other households. In total almost 30% of fuelpoor households had living room temperatures below 18°C and more than two thirds had living room temperatures below 20°C. Overall nearly half of all non-fuel-poor homes had living room temperatures below 20°C. In households with persons aged over 65 years, 16% had living room temperatures below 18°C and over 50% had temperatures below 20°C. On the other end of the scale over 5% of households occupied by persons over 65 years experienced living room temperatures of ≥24°C.https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1089&context=scienmas

%The quality of Swedish EPC data was initially studied by Göransson [41], subsequently by Claesson [42], Mangold et al. [21] and Hårsman et al. [43], and most recently by Pasichnyi et al. [6]. These studies have found a couple of important deficiencies in Swedish EPC data. First, the energy expert, and the firm he or she belongs to, has been shown to generate variations in Swedish EPC data [43], [44]. More specifically, Hårsman et al. [43] found that the energy expert along with the characteristics of the firm caused a variation of ±20% in the assessment of energy consumption.
%Second, through interviews with energy experts, Claesson [42] found that most EPCs contain uncertain estimates of energy use as well as arbitrarily distributed values—thus challenging the notion that Swedish EPC data quality, while allegedly measured, should be superior to the quality of calculated values in other member states.

DEAP - The space heat use is defined in IS EN 13790 as the heat delivered to the heated space by an ideal heating
system to maintain the set-point temperature during a given period of time. The DEAP calculation of space
heat use is done on a monthly basis based on the procedure described in IS EN 13790. A single-zone
calculation is used, using a single average value of mean internal temperature as described in Section 7.In DEAP, the heating season is defined as running from October to May inclusive. The annual space heat use
is the sum of monthly values for these eight months.
The heating hours and required internal temperatures in DEAP are based on the requirements of a typical
household. The schedule is as follows.
• Weekdays: 07.00 to 09.00 and 17.00 to 23.00
• Weekends: 07.00 to 09.00 and 17.00 to 23.00
This standardised schedule represents a total heating period of 56 hours per week.

% textit{To accommodate an expanding population, the number of dwellings has also increased to currently stand at 1.7 million households, although this fgure remains signifcantly short of projected housing need, withannual average demand estimated to be up to 36,000 units for the next 30 years (IBEC 2018). Yet despite the number of new homes built to ever increasing energy performance standards, the Irish housing stock is among the poorest in Europe in terms of energy effciency (Goggins et al. 2016). Current trends also show that households are getting bigger, with an average 15\% increase in foor area across all homes between 2000 and 2016 (SEAI 2018) \cite{FahyEnergyPractice}}
%
% The growth rate of the housing stock in the period to 2030 is obtained from the ESRI's macroeconomic estimates \citep{Yakut2020}. 
% A multiple linear regression is calculated to project future housing stock based on population size and occupancy rate beyond 2030. The total housing stock is expected to increase by 79\% in 2050 relative to 2018 to accommodate the growing population and declining occupancy rates. The share of apartments changes from 12\% in 2018 to 24\% in 2050, while the shares of attached and detached dwellings decline by 4\% and 8\% respectively.
Historical population estimates and future projections are obtained from the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ireland \citep{CentralStatisticsOffice2020}. We use the M2F1 scenario since it represents medium growth in population and is in line with population projections used in other national sources \citep{Yakut2020}. 

% Energy service demands in the residential sector are driven by the size of the housing stock by type (apartment, attached or detached), which in turn is driven by population growth and the occupancy rate, the average number of people per dwelling. The occupancy rate is expected to fall to 2.12 in 2051 \citep{PropertyIndustryIreland2019}, from 2.75 in 2016 (CSO). Intermediate values are estimated using Equation \ref{eq:OR}.

The residential stock projections upto 2040 are taken from ESRI's housing demand estimates \citep{Bergin2020}. The stock is expected to increase by 40\% from 2018 level with a CAGR of 2\%. This results in an average of 27,600 new houses per annum between between 2021-2040. Beyond 2040, population is used as a driver to project housing stock. The total housing stock obtained in 2050 is 2.57 million which implies 8\% increase from 2040.

Space heating is the largest residential energy service demand, accounted for 61.8\% of final energy usage in 2018. Other residential energy services and their share of final energy is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:Ireland2018ServiceDemands}. As building thermal efficiency and heating technology efficiency improves, both space and water heating energy would be expected to decline. The new A-rated dwellings can be used as a guide to show the share of future energy service demands. From the BER database, it can be seen that A-rated dwellings use less than half space heating energy of the average dwelling and A-rated water heating energy decreases by about 40\% compared to the average A-rated dwelling. However Pumps \& Fans energy increases as mechanical ventilation is used over natural ventilation and Lighting usage in A-rated is more than double the average household. Cooking and Appliances energy usage would be expected to remain stable.

Notably absent from Fig.\ref{fig:Ireland2018ServiceDemands}, is space cooling, which is accounted for in appliances. The Policy Oriented Tool for Energy and Climate Change Impact Assessment (POTEnCIA) project disaggregated Ireland's residential space cooling from appliances and have output expected space cooling energy consumption projections are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:Cooling}.

The SEAI residential energy report \cite{SustainableEnergyAuthorityofIreland2018EnergySector} provides high resolution detail on energy demands in the residential sector. Variables such as disposable income, appliance ownership, dwelling location, type of occupier status (owner/rented ), BER labels and age of dwelling. 



%Space Heating demand - BER space heating is only within certain months and assumes 21C heating..
Thermostats are not widely used for temperature regulation in private dwellings in Ireland; instead the domestic heating schedule was assumed to be 07.00–09.00 h and 17.00–23.00 h for a heating season of October to May inclusive, based on guidelines issued by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) [32]. The thermal load consists of both space heating and a baseline demand for sustaining water heating. For non-domestic premises the thermal load is defined by office hours, in line with the electrical demand. The domestic thermal loads considered in this study are listed in Table 2; the thermal load for the non-domestic

GROWTH CONSTRAINT -A specific type of constraint may be defined to limit the share of process (p) in the total production of commodity (c). The constraint indicates that the flow of commodity (c) from/to process (p) - CommodiTypically, a growth constraint is of the following generic form (ignoring several indices for clarity: \cite{Loulou2016EnergyProgramme}
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
VAR\_CAP(t + 1) \leq (1 + GROWTH^{M(t+1)-M(t)}) \cdot VAR\_CAP(t)+K
\end{split}
\label{Eq:GrowthConstraint}
\end{equation}
The GROWTH coefficient is defined as a new attribute of the technology, and represents the maximum annual growth allowed for the capacity. The quantity M(t+1)-M(t) is the number of years between the milestones of periods t and t+1. The constant K is useful whenever the technology has no capacity initially, in order to allow capacity to build over time (if K were absent and initial capacity is zero, the technology would never acquire any capacity)
Note that the sign of the constraint may also be of the "larger than or equal to" type to express a maximum rate of abandonment, in which case the "+" sign is replaced by a "–" sign in the right-hand-side of the constraint. Equality is also allowed, but must be used only exceptionally in order to avoid railroading of the model.

%the new A-rated houses behave distinctively different which much less demand on space heating and with pumps and fans energy consumption usage increasing, while appliance end use is increasing across the BER ratings. The number of appliances has increased rapidly and while energy efficient improves are  reducing the energy per appliance, it is overshadowed by the growth in electrical appliances. There retrofitting grant which  requires building to have a HLI indication of 2 or less before a heat pump grant can be installs. Ireland’s aim of retrofitting 0.5 million homes from the existing 1.7 million in the before 2030. The effect of these targets also stretches out across the construction sector. The savings from retrofits will decrease fossil fuel energy usage, while most houses 00\% would need to get heat pumps too, to fulfil 0.4 million existing houses getting heat pumps.  This energy efficiency first approach would allow for future technology choices, when current boiler are not at end of life. 

TIM was built to help Ireland provide a pathway to achieve 2030 and 2050 targets. The residential sector plays a key part of this and it was built from the SEAI 2018 energy balance, the BER database and CSO data. The data filtration process used in the residential sector, derived a lot of conversation of the BER database, a group know as Ireland Energy Wiki by the National Retrofitting Modelling Group grew from building the residential sector, questions about the filters, default values, assumptions around thermal equations (EC..) and uncertainties were used to improve the data before it was used in TIM . TIM has many internal project deadines, which required extensive meetings about the data, constraints and results as the modelling was progressing. The data and results were presented to 30 external reviewers to provide feedback, this process proved invaluable having different expertise with different presepectives enabled TIM to fill in gaps. TIM will also be open platform to help improve the model and provide transparency. TIM’s residential sector was built in parallel with LEAP’s residential sector, so that residential sector can easily simulate policy. The demand for results from TIM has increased significantly with increased government ambition, TIM will provide input into CAP 2021 and Ireland’s carbon budgets, working with DECC and the CCAC respectively will also provide feedback and improve the robustness of TIM. for these reasons TIM residential sector is a state of the art modelling platform.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{Conclusion}
This paper reports results on ambitious mitigation target in the period to 2050 for the Irish energy system. The analysis have been performed using the Irish TIMES model
\textit{We stress the importance of differentiating between technical con-
straints and behavioural constraints in optimisation models. Including both conflates what is considered desirable under the economic welfare paradigm (i.e. cost-minimising decisions) with “realistic decisions”, complicating the interpretation of the results. Optimisation models are by design well suited to study cost-optimal behaviour, and running scenarios just with technical constraints facilitates the identification of areas where market barriers are more entrenched, and interventions to accelerate the uptake of low-carbon practices may be needed.} \cite{Astudillo2017CanModelb}
